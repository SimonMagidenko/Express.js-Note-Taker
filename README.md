## Description

This project was built to allow users a platform that they could use to take quick notes on the go! I built this project to showcase my ability to use NodeJS, ExpressJS, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I was able to combine my knowledge on all of these languages and frameworks to create a simple yet complex application that puts everything together.This application acts as a sticky note pad, rather than having to carry around notes for reminders or to-do's, simply use the ExpressJS Note Taker to quickly and easily store notes on the go from any device! During this build, I was able to strengthen my understanding of ExpressJS and how it gives developers to build there very own servers!
